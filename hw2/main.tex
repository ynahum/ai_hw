\section*{A - Improved Greedy Agent}

\subsection*{A.1}

We will use the following parameters:\\
1. Agent location.\\
2. Passengers' locations.\\
3. Agent's cash.\\
4. Gas stations locations.\\

We will calculate Manhattan Distances (MD) from each taxi agent to each passenger $MD(s,loc_{passenger})$ and add to it the distance to its destination $MD(loc_{passenger},loc_{drop-off})$.\\
We calculate that for each passenger relative to each agent.\\
As a greedy agent, we go to the passenger that will give us the best value (closest and thus no gas wasting) w/o actually caring about the other agent actions (although we can consider his worst action, but it complicates the agent value estimation).\\
We need to take into consideration some constraints. otherwise, we go to the gas station:\\
1. The cash after the planned drop should be enough to go the closest gas station from the drop location. If not, we consider the other passenger.
2. We check the same constraint as before on the new passenger's drop location vs the closest gas station location. If not, we ..

If the other agent is closer, we will go on the second passenger.
As the distance is smaller, the value of the state is higher. So we inverse the distance to get a value function for our state by $\frac{1}{d}$
We may have negative 
 to first passenger and then to its destination and the same to the second passenger . We calculate the same for the other agent (to consider who will win).
